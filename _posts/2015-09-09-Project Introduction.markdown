#Introduction:

Our overall goal in this project is to apply various statistical tools in order to establish process-structure-property linkages
within a Nanoporous metal foam. Platinum Nanoporous foam is a species of nanoporous metal foams. Metal foams are typically manufactured through electrochemically dealloying in 0.3% aqueous HF acid
and using co-sputtered physical vapor deposition (PVD) on silicon wafers. The parameters controlled within this process were the negative
substrate bias voltage in sputtering V, the thickness of the film layer u, and the concentration of platinum in Platinum Silicide: $$ Pt_xSi_(1-x) $$ Where V= 0,100,300 u=1um and 10um  x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.35

#Understanding the Process

Previous work on platinum nanoporous foams has identified different morphologies dependent upon process parameters. The three major morphologies identified from manipulating the process parameters are 
the isotropic open-cell, the columnar and the voroni morphologies identified at length scales between 100-150nm. 

Note: Figure A is pre-dealloying. Dealloying was done under a constant potential 0.6V in an aqueous solution of 0.3% HF acid.
