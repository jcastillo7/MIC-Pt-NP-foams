#Introduction:

Our overall goal in this project is to apply various statistical tools in order to establish process-structure-property linkages
within a Nanoporous metal foam. Platinum Nanoporous foam (Pt-NP foam) is a species of nanoporous metal foams. The potential applciations of the Pt-NP foams include components within fuel cells and sensors as well as anitmicrobial scaffolds. The Pt-NP foam is synthesized through electrochemically dealloying 
and using co-sputtered physical vapor deposition (PVD) on silicon wafers. The parameters controlled within this process were the negative
substrate bias voltage in sputtering *V*, the thickness of the film layer *t*, and the concentration of Platinum in Platinum Silicide: $$ Pt_{x}Si_{1-x} $$ Where *x* = 0.1, 0.2, 0.35 ; *V*= 0,100,300 ; *t*=1um and 10um  

#Example Datasets:

Previous work on platinum nanoporous foams has identified different morphologies identified through changing process parameters. The three major morphologies identified from manipulating the process parameters are 
the isotropic open-cell, the columnar and the voroni morphologies identified at various length scales shown below. 

Note: Figure (a) for all is pre-dealloying. Dealloying was done under a constant potential 0.6V in an aqueous solution of 3% HF acid.

##Empirical Process-Structure Relationship
Below is a map generated to demonstrate possible structures resulting from the manipulating of the various process parameters described above.

#Plan forward

Our goal proceeding forward is to first obtain structural mechanical properties through the use of nanoindentation. SEM imaging will be performed and meta data generated using 2-pt statistics and a reductive technique such as PCA will be used to build a structure-property linkage. After this, a similar procedure will be applied to formulate process-structure linkages.
