# Proposed workflow:

**This proposed workflow defines our projects steps from generating the needed data to defining the sp linkage.**

1. **Evaluate the available data. Determine how much more data is needed.**

2. **Perform SEM/EBSD to generate more data (if needed)**

3. **Perform nanoedentation to generate the elastic properties**

4. **Generate the metadata of the extracted material features**

5. **Define the microstructure function from the state definition**

6. **Perform a 2-point statistic**

7. **Perform a PCA /dimension reduction**

8. **Define the structure-property linkage**
