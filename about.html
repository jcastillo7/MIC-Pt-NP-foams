This project page will present the results of the material informatics class project. The goal of this project is to generate 
a psp linkage for the Platinum nanoporous foam (Pt-NP foam). We will use data science tools such as n-points statistics, 
dimentional reduction..., to generate some material metadata and find a relation between the material microstructure and his 
mechanical properties.
